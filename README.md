# Risk Assessment and Data-Driven Recommendations for Aircraft Acquisition

## Overview

This document summarizes the analysis of aircraft accident data to assess potential risks associated with entering the aviation industry. The analysis aims to identify factors contributing to accidents and guide informed decision-making regarding aircraft purchases for commercial and private operations.

## Business Understanding

**Stakeholders**: This analysis is primarily aimed at the head of the new aviation division within the company, along with other stakeholders involved in the aviation business venture.

### Key Business Questions:
- What are the primary risk factors associated with aircraft accidents?
- Which aircraft models offer a lower risk profile for our business endeavors?
- How can we mitigate risks and enhance safety within our potential aviation operations?

## Data Understanding and Analysis

**Source of Data**: The data utilized in this analysis is not explicitly specified, but it is assumed to be a collection of aircraft accident records.

**Description of Data**: The data likely includes information on various aspects of accidents, such as:
- Aircraft model
- Number of engines
- Engine type
- Purpose of flight
- Weather conditions
- Extent of damage

## Data Visualization and Analysis

### 1. **Phase of Flight vs. Accident Distribution**:
This visualization highlights the phases of flight with the highest frequency of accidents, aiding in targeting safety measures for critical stages like landing and maneuvering.

### 2. **Aircraft Make and Engine Type vs. Accident Count**:
This visualization identifies aircraft models and engine types with a higher risk profile, allowing for a more informed selection of safer aircraft for purchase.

### 3. **Purpose of Flight vs. Accident Distribution**:
This visualization reveals flight purposes with a higher accident rate, suggesting a need for stricter safety protocols or operational adjustments for those categories.

### 4. **Additional Visualization: Extent of Damage**:
The analysis should also consider the extent of damage caused by accidents. A bar chart can illustrate the distribution of accidents across categories like "Substantial Damage," "Destroyed," "Minor Damage," and "Unknown." This information emphasizes the potential severity of accidents and underscores the importance of risk mitigation strategies.
