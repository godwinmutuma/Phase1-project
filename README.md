# Risk Assessment and Data-Driven Recommendations for Aircraft Acquisition

## Overview

This document summarizes the analysis of aircraft accident data to assess potential risks associated with entering the aviation industry. The analysis aims to identify factors contributing to accidents and guide informed decision-making regarding aircraft purchases for commercial and private operations.

## Business Understanding

**Stakeholders**: This analysis is primarily aimed at the head of the new aviation division within the company, along with other stakeholders involved in the aviation business venture.

### Key Business Questions:
- What are the primary risk factors associated with aircraft accidents?
- Which aircraft models offer a lower risk profile for our business endeavors?
- How can we reduce risks and enhance safety within our potential aviation operations?

## Data Understanding and Analysis

**Source of Data**: The data utilized in this analysis is not explicitly specified, but it is assumed to be a collection of aircraft accident records.

**Description of Data**: The data likely includes information on various aspects of accidents, such as:
- Aircraft model
- Number of engines
- Engine type
- Purpose of flight
- Weather conditions
- Extent of damage

## Data Visualization and Analysis

### 1. **Phase of Flight vs. Accident Distribution**:
This visualization highlights the phases of flight with the highest frequency of accidents, aiding in targeting safety measures for critical stages like landing and maneuvering.

### 2. **Aircraft Make and Engine Type vs. Accident Count**:
This visualization identifies aircraft models and engine types with a higher risk profile, allowing for a more informed selection of safer aircraft for purchase.

### 3. **Purpose of Flight vs. Accident Distribution**:
This visualization reveals flight purposes with a higher accident rate, suggesting a need for stricter safety protocols or operational adjustments for those categories.

### 4. **Additional Visualization: Extent of Damage**:
The analysis should also consider the extent of damage caused by accidents. A bar chart can illustrate the distribution of accidents across categories like "Substantial Damage," "Destroyed," "Minor Damage," and "Unknown." This information emphasizes the potential severity of accidents and underscores the importance of risk mitigation strategies.

## Conclusion

From the analysis, I came up with the following conclusion and recommendation:

- Choose Multi-Engine Aircraft: Buy planes with two or more engines to lower the risk of engine failure and in case of an engine failure there can be a backup.
- Consider Turbo Jet Engines: Jet engines may cost more but usually have fewer accidents than reciprocating engines.
- Avoid High-Risk Models: From the analysis, some aircraft models tend to pose more risk with Model 152, 172 and 172N having relatively very high incidents hence I can term them as riskier.
- Focusing on Commercial and Cargo Flights: These types of operations generally have fewer accidents compared to personal or business flights.
- Monitor Weather: The company can invest more in weather monitoring tools as well as improving the pilots' skills since from the analysis where I was comparing the weather conditions and their relative number of accidents, I noted that many accidents occurred in the (Visual Metrological Conditions (VMC)) where the pilots are advised to fly by sight compared to (Instrumental Metrological Conditions (IMS)) where the pilots use weather monitoring tools.
- Maintain Aircraft Carefully: I propose this because, having some aircraft with only a single engine, hence no backups, requires a fully functional engine and this can be achieved by regular inspections to make sure everything is well.
- Acquire Insurance: From the analysis, some aircraft are damaged, some have substantial damage and others have minor damage. These damages can be costly to repair and in case of any serious injuries from those on board, the treatment too can be costly hence getting insurance is advised.
